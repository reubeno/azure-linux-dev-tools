# Components

Components are the primary unit of packaging in azldev. Each component corresponds to one or more RPM packages and is defined under `[components.<name>]` in the TOML configuration.

A component definition tells azldev where to find the spec file, how to customize it with overlays, how to configure the build, and what additional source files to download.

## Component Config

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Spec source | `spec` | [SpecSource](#spec-source) | No | Where to find the spec file for this component. Inherited from distro defaults if not specified. |
| Overlays | `overlays` | array of [Overlay](overlays.md) | No | Modifications to apply to the spec and/or source files |
| Build config | `build` | [BuildConfig](#build-configuration) | No | Build-time options (macros, conditionals, check config) |
| Source files | `source-files` | array of [SourceFileReference](#source-file-references) | No | Additional source files to download for this component |

### Bare Components

The simplest component definition is a bare entry with no fields. This inherits all configuration from the distro defaults:

```toml
[components.curl]
```

With a default distro config pointing to Fedora 43, this is equivalent to explicitly writing:

```toml
[components.curl]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-distro = { name = "fedora", version = "43" } }
```

Bare entries are the most common component definition — the majority of components in a typical project need no per-component customization.

### File Organization

- **Inline** definitions in a shared file (e.g., `components.toml`) are preferred for bare components with no customization.
- **Dedicated** files (e.g., `bash/bash.comp.toml`) are preferred when a component has overlays, build config, or other customization.

The `includes = ["**/*.comp.toml"]` pattern in `components.toml` automatically picks up all dedicated component files.

> **Note:** Each component name must be unique across all config files. Defining the same component in two files produces an error.

## Spec Source

The `spec` field identifies where azldev should find the RPM spec file for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Source type | `type` | string | **Yes** | Spec source type: `"upstream"`, `"local"`, or `""` (empty) |
| Path | `path` | string | No | Path to the spec file (for `local` type). Relative to the config file. |
| Upstream distro | `upstream-distro` | [DistroReference](distros.md#distro-references) | No | Which distro to pull the spec from (for `upstream` type) |
| Upstream name | `upstream-name` | string | No | Package name in the upstream distro, if different from the component name |
| Upstream commit | `upstream-commit` | string | No | Git commit hash (7–40 hex chars) to pin the upstream spec to. Takes priority over the distro snapshot. |

### Upstream Specs (Default)

Most components use upstream specs pulled from a distro's dist-git repository. If no `spec` is defined, the component inherits the upstream distro from the `default-component-config` in the distro version config:

```toml
# Uses the default upstream distro (inherited from distro config)
[components.curl]

# Explicitly specifies the upstream distro and version
[components.bash]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-distro = { name = "fedora", version = "rawhide" } }
```

When the upstream package has a different name than the component, use `upstream-name`:

```toml
[components.azurelinux-rpm-config]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-name = "redhat-rpm-config" }
```

### Commit-Pinned Specs

When you need to pin to a specific git commit — for example, to pick up a fix that hasn't been included in a tagged release yet — use `upstream-commit`:

```toml
[components.bash]
spec = { type = "upstream", upstream-commit = "a1b2c3d4e5f6789" }
```

The value must be a hex string between 7 and 40 characters (a short or full git commit hash). When `upstream-commit` is set, it takes priority over the distro snapshot date — azldev checks out the exact commit instead of finding the latest commit before a snapshot timestamp.

> **Note:** Commit-pinning is intended for temporary use. Once the desired change lands in a tagged upstream release, switch back to version-based pinning or the default snapshot to keep the component aligned with the upstream distro.

### Local Specs

For components that originate from your project (not imported from upstream), use a local spec:

```toml
[components.azurelinux-release]
spec = { type = "local", path = "azurelinux-release.spec" }
```

The `path` is relative to the config file that defines the component. Local spec files and any associated source files should be placed alongside the component's `.comp.toml` file.

## Build Configuration

The `[components.<name>.build]` section controls build-time options for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| With options | `with` | string array | No | Build conditionals to enable (`--with <option>` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Without options | `without` | string array | No | Build conditionals to disable (`--without <option>` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Macro definitions | `defines` | map of string to string | No | RPM macro definitions (`--define '<name> <value>'` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Undefined macros | `undefines` | string array | No | RPM macro names to undefine (`--undefine '<name>'` passed to rpmbuild) |
| Check config | `check` | [CheckConfig](#check-configuration) | No | Configuration for the `%check` section of the spec |
| Failure config | `failure` | [FailureConfig](#failure-configuration) | No | Configuration and policy regarding build failures |
| Build hints | `hints` | [BuildHints](#build-hints) | No | Non-essential hints for how or when to build the component |

### With / Without Options

These correspond to rpmbuild's `--with` and `--without` flags, which toggle `%bcond` conditionals in spec files:

```toml
# Enable the "as_wget" build conditional
[components.wget2.build]
with = ["as_wget"]

# Disable the "debug" kernel variant to reduce build time
[components.kernel.build]
without = ["debug"]

# Disable the RedHat subscription manager plugin
[components.dnf5.build]
without = ["plugin_rhsm"]
```

### Macro Definitions

The `defines` field sets RPM macros that are available during the build. Each key-value pair becomes a `--define 'key value'` argument to rpmbuild:

```toml
[components.mypackage.build]
defines = { rhel = "11" }
```

The `undefines` field removes macros that would otherwise be defined:

```toml
[components.mypackage.build]
undefines = ["fedora"]
```

### Check Configuration

The `check` field controls the `%check` section of the spec (the package's test suite).

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Skip | `skip` | boolean | No | When `true`, disables the `%check` section by prepending `exit 0` (defaults to `false`) |
| Skip reason | `skip_reason` | string | Conditional | Justification for why tests are being skipped. **Required when `skip` is `true`.** |

```toml
[components.containerd.build]
check = { skip = true, skip_reason = "Tests require network access unavailable in build environment" }
```

> **Note:** The `skip_reason` field is mandatory when `skip` is `true`. This ensures that disabling tests is always documented and traceable. azldev will report a validation error if `skip_reason` is missing.

### Failure Configuration

The `failure` field configures how azldev handles build failures for a component.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Expected | `expected` | boolean | No | When `true`, indicates that this component is expected to fail building (defaults to `false`) |
| Expected reason | `expected-reason` | string | Conditional | Justification for why the component is expected to fail. **Required when `expected` is `true`.** |

This is intended as a temporary marker for components that are known to fail until they can be fixed — for example, when importing a batch of packages where some have unresolved dependency issues:

```toml
[components.broken-package.build]
failure = { expected = true, expected-reason = "Missing build dependency not yet available in Azure Linux" }
```

> **Note:** The `expected-reason` field is mandatory when `expected` is `true`. This ensures that expected failures are always documented and traceable.

### Build Hints

The `hints` field provides non-essential metadata about how or when to build a component. These hints do not affect build correctness but may be used by tools and CI systems for scheduling and resource allocation.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Expensive | `expensive` | boolean | No | When `true`, indicates that building this component is resource-intensive and should be carefully considered when scheduling (defaults to `false`) |

```toml
[components.kernel.build]
hints = { expensive = true }
```

## Source File References

The `[[components.<name>.source-files]]` array defines additional source files that azldev should download before building. These are files not available in the dist-git repository or lookaside cache — typically binaries, pre-built artifacts, or files from custom hosting.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Filename | `filename` | string | **Yes** | Name of the file as it will appear in the sources directory |
| Hash | `hash` | string | No | Expected hash of the downloaded file for integrity verification |
| Hash type | `hash-type` | string | No | Hash algorithm used (e.g., `"SHA512"`, `"SHA256"`) |
| Origin | `origin` | [Origin](#origin) | **Yes** | Where to download the file from |

### Origin

The `origin` field specifies how to obtain the source file.

| Field | TOML Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Type | `type` | string | **Yes** | Origin type: `"download"` or `"cargo-vendor"`. |
| URI | `uri` | string | No | URI to download the file from (required when type is `"download"`) |
| Version | `version` | string | No | Explicit crate version for `"cargo-vendor"` origins. When omitted, the version is extracted from the component's spec file. |
| Crate name | `crate-name` | string | No | Explicit crate name for `"cargo-vendor"` origins. When omitted, the crate name is derived from the component name (stripping any `rust-` prefix). |

#### Origin type: `download`

Downloads the file from the specified URI. Requires the `uri` field.

#### Origin type: `cargo-vendor`

Generates a vendored Cargo dependency archive by running `rust2rpm`. This is
useful for Rust packages that need pre-vendored dependencies for offline builds.

The crate name is resolved with the following priority:

1. Explicit `crate-name` property (if set)
2. Component name with `rust-` prefix stripped (if the name starts with `rust-`)
3. Component name as-is

The crate version is resolved by:

1. Explicit `version` property (if set) — avoids the overhead of spec parsing
2. Parsing the `Version:` tag from the component's spec file (requires a build environment)

**Prerequisite:** `rust2rpm` must be installed on the host. If it is missing, azldev
will offer to install it automatically.

### Examples

#### Download origin

```toml
[[components.shim.source-files]]
filename = "shimx64.efi"
hash = "7741013d9a24ce554bf6a9df6b776a57b114055e..."
hash-type = "SHA512"
origin = { type = "download", uri = "https://example.com/repo/pkgs/shim/shimx64.efi/sha512/.../shimx64.efi" }

[[components.shim.source-files]]
filename = "shimaa64.efi"
hash = "57aa116d1c91a9ec36ab8b46c9164ae19af192b..."
hash-type = "SHA512"
origin = { type = "download", uri = "https://example.com/repo/pkgs/shim/shimaa64.efi/sha512/.../shimaa64.efi" }
```

#### Cargo-vendor origin (version auto-extracted from spec)

```toml
[[components.rust-ripgrep.source-files]]
filename = "vendor.tar.xz"
origin = { type = "cargo-vendor" }
```

#### Cargo-vendor origin (explicit version and crate name)

```toml
[[components.rust-ripgrep.source-files]]
filename = "vendor.tar.xz"
origin = { type = "cargo-vendor", version = "14.1.1", crate-name = "ripgrep" }
```
